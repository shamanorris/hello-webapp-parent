This project makes usage of aspectj-utils dependency to have logging through AOP in all methods that are annotated with @Logging.
Most of the code is in the dependency lib.

This version initially has the goal of reproducing an error of NoSuchMethod thrown in an rest application with implementation across dependencies.
